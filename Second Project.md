## Web stack implementation (lemp stack)

On this project I continued to implemeent Webstack using sql syntax.

I created a DB using sql and ran simple commands such as creating a table, entering data in the table and attempted to display the table via a public https - this didn't work though, but I manahed to get the DB displayed in my terminal.

I was unable to run and save this command "nano /var/www/projectLEMP/todo_list.php".  Each time I tried it I got a page that displayed the "to-do" list content, but it won't save.  

I am able ot use the contol x command, which asks me if I want to save before exiting, I select Yes, then enter.

The terminal returns back this image:

When I proceed to view the list via: http://ec2-13-40-78-69.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/todo_list.php or http://13.40.78.69/todo_list.php, I get a blank page.
