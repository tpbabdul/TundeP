  Project 4 - MEAN STACK implementation (creating a Library repository)

On this project, I created a web based book register (Repository).  the DB was Mongo DB, the back-end app t orequest the data was Express, Angular for the front end request nd Node.js (Java script) to acceps the request and display result to the requestor.

the commands were relatively straightforward to follow, however, I realised that there was some errors when i was copying the webserver codes into some files.

I was getting error messages which I tried to resolve with google, but was unsuccessful until I had to go through each code line by line.

On this project, I had to recall several commands which wasn't very obvious when I followed the script line, by line...e.g when creating a file, it was handy that I remembered to use "touch" command as it was't in the script, but thankfully I was able to recall.

I also used the "cat" command to view codes I had pasted in the html file which is good as I could check if the code was copied correctly to save time from re-entering it.


Eventully, I was able to get through it.
