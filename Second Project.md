## Web stack implementation (lemp stack)

On this project I continued to implemeent Webstack using sql syntax.

I created a DB using sql and ran simple commands such as creating a table, entering data in the table and attempted to display the table via a public https - this didn't work though, but I manahed to get the DB displayed in my terminal.
